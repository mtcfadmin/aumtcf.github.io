            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Founded in 1998, MTCF had a humble beginning with eight families starting to praise and worship our Lord & Savior Jesus Christ in individual houses. Since then, MTCF has steadily grown in the Lord and also the number of families gathering has increased to more than 100 families spread across Victoria.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children who were part of initial years of MTCF, have now grown and excelled in many different professions, contributing to our society and bringing Glory to our Lord. 
            </p>
            <p>
                MTCF has been involved in many fun filled retreats, camps, children's programs and sporting activities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each month, any two of our member families collaborate and jointly host the month's meeting. These families are responsible for planning & conducting the meeting. Some of the other responsibilities also include:
            </p>

                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Pray for God's anointing for an effective meeting.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Plan, communicate, and deliver the program, leveraging off the resource teams for Prayer, Worship, Children and Finance.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i>Prepare the venue, set up the PA system, pack up the equipment and clean the premises after the meeting.

                    Scripture Time: This could be a message delivered by one of the organisers or by an external speaker, or a group Bible study.
